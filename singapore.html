	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore, an island city-state off southern Malaysia, is a global financial center with a tropical climate and multicultural population. Its colonial core centers on the Padang, a cricket field since the 1830s and now flanked by grand buildings such as City Hall, with its 18 Corinthian columns. In Singapore's circa-1820 Chinatown stands the red-and-gold Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, said to house one of Buddha's teeth.

          The incredible shopping malls, classy boutiques, departmental stores on Orchard Road, the exotic elements of Chinatown and Little India and the world-class nightlife span across the spotless land of Singapore. Expensive with respect to South-eastern standards, the city offers a plethora of other options for entertainment such as Sentosa Island, Singapore Zoo, Botanic Garden, Marina Bay Sands, Tiger Balm Garden, and the Night Safari. With picture-perfect skyline and city centre bustling with crowds of people, Singapore is one of the most popular travel destinations for a lot of reasons.
